==Task Allocation==：

* parse.c and parse.h contain **helper functions**, **syntax rule parsing functions**, and essential **parser operations**.

**Implemented by Zhao Yunhao.**

* syntax_tree.c handles the construction and management of the **syntax tree**.  **Implemented by Zhao Yunhao.**

* parse_print.c is responsible for **printing the syntax tree** and related debugging outputs. **Implemented by Zhang Zuokun.**
* ==debug together==
* use cmake to compile them (CMakeLists.txt)

Encounter obstacles that we can not solve: 
Such segmentation fault :

During the experience , we understand the principle of designing a set of grammar, and are familiar with  how to write parse function with recursive function... Unfortunately，some errors hinder our successful compilation.

I hope Professor could give us some instructions to overcome them.
